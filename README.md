# Project Proposal
## Summary and Vision
Wordeo is a word guessing game similar to Wordle and Hangman.  In the base game, users try to spell a word with a given hint as quickly as possible within a given time limit.  Users can create an account to submit their scores, create rooms to play multiplayer, and earn in-game currency to purchase power-ups.

Wordeo is a game created for users who want to stimulate their brains while learning new words in a fun environment.  Wordeo challenges users to compete with each other on quick thinking.  Power-ups provide an additional strategy for users who want to top the leaderboards.

Wordeo is targeted at users on all levels.  As the user progresses through the words, the difficulty increases to continuously provide new challenges.  Speed is the key in Wordeo, as the points the user gains depend on how quickly they can guess.

Therefore, our stakeholders would be:
1. The Puzzlers Team
2. Our classmates in COMP 4350
3. Shayan Daneshvar (our TA in COMP 4350)
4. Shaowei Wang (our instructor in COMP 4350)
